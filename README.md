# tsuru.io website

This is the [tsuru.io](http://tsuru.io) landing page.

## Setting up

You must have [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) installed.
After that, clone this project:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:tsuru/tsuru.io.git
```

And install the dependencies:
```shell
$ cd tsuru.io
$ npm install
```

That's it. You're set.

## Running & developing

Having the dependencies installed, just `grunt run`:

```shell
$ cd tsuru.io
$ grunt run
```

Now you can access it locally at `localhost:7777`.  
At any changes, the page will be automatically generated again.
