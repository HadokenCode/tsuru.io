	<p>{% trans %}Tsuru is an open source polyglot cloud application platform. With Tsuru, you donâ€™t need to think about servers at all. You can write apps in the programming language of your choice, bind it with add-on resources such as SQL and NoSQL databases, memcached, redis, and many others. You manage your app using the Tsuru command-line tool and you deploy code using the Git revision control system, all running on the Tsuru infrastructure.{% endtrans %}</p>
